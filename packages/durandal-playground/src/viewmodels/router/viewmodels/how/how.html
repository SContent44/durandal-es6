            We also are able to split our routes from the main application into asynchronous routes using
            <code>dynamic imports</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This child route is a <code>static import</code> for the parent route so it is bundled together with it,
            however the parent route is <code>dynamically imported</code> so it's split from our main applications
            bundle.
        </p>

            You can see this in action if you open the developer console and click on the do a refresh of this page
            without caching.
